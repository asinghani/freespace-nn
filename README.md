# Freespace Segmentation on Autonomous Robots

This repository contains various experiments and code associated with my research work on freespace-segmentation for detection of negative obstacles on indoor and outdoor robots. This repository includes several important experiments conducted during this research, including all data preprocessing, augmentation, inference, labelling, and optimizations.

Please see <https://github.com/asinghani/freespace-robot> for robot-control code associated with this project.
